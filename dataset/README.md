## Form Understanding in Noisy Scanned Documents (FUNSD)
To train OCR models, the FUNSD dataset from Jaume, et al ([2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13538.pdf)) was utilized. The dataset consists of 5304 relations, 9707 semantic entities, 31485 words, and 199 fully annotated forms. Form annotation, or ground truth, is stored in the JSON file format.
